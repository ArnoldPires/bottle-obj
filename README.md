# Doing the node
Install node.js on to your computer and get the lastest version:
  
  https://nodejs.org/en

cd into the folder you are working on and type "npm init"

Go through the prompt

Type "npm install express --save

create a folder called views

In the folder create any file like this: "name.ejs"

Go back to terminal and type " npm install ejs --save"

Get out of that folder and create a file called "app.js" in the root folder

To get things to work, you need to add code into the app.js file.

The hello world verison can be found here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html

To view the app.js file, go back to the terminal and type "node app.js"

Go to browser and type "localhost:3000"

Your file should now display on the webpage
